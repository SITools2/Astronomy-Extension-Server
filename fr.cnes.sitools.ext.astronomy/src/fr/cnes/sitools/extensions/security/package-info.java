/**
This package contains the security classes for the data storage. 

 <p>
 A data storage is a directory from the file system that is put online on the web.
  
 When the administrator configures a data storage, all files in this data storage are
 available.<br/><br/>
 The access to a datastorage can be restricted to a specific profile.
 However, only the access to specific extensions and the access to some files 
 for some users who are included in the same profile are not possible.
 Thus, the purpose of these extensions is to customize the access to the files 
 by different ways:
 <ul>
 <li>by checking a pattern in the filename that is requested</li>
 <li>by delegating the access rights to an external database</li>
 </ul>
 All these extensions are based on the following sequence diagram:
