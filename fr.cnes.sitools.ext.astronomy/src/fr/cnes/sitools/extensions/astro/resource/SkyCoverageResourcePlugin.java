/**
 * Configures the coverage service by the use of Healpix MOC.
 *
 * <p>
 * This service processes a sky coverage by given Healpix MOCs as input parameters.
 * One input parameter is described by a URL. The output is a sky coverage.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p> 
 * Model of the coverage service. This model provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>metadata that is displayed in the administration panel</li>
 * <li>the business class that processes the coverage</li>
 * <li>the DatasetSelection to None. This means this service is not displayed as a plugin of a dataset.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>This service answers to the following scenario:<br/>
 * As user, I want to know the sky coverage of my survey and its representation in the sky
 * in order to give me an idea where data are located.
